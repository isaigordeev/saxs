"""
Module: AbstractRequestingStage.

This module defines the `AbstractRequestingStage` base class, which
extends `AbstractStage` to support stage approval requests in a
pipeline.

The `AbstractRequestingStage` class provides a framework for
generating requests that can be processed according to
a chaining policy (`ChainingPolicy`).
Subclasses must implement methods to define a default policy and
create specific stage requests (`StageRequest`).

Key Classes:
    - AbstractRequestingStage: Base class for stages capable of
    requesting downstream approval stages.
