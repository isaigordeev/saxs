"""pipeline.py.

This module defines the `Pipeline` class, which manages the dynamic
execution of SAXS (Small-Angle X-ray Scattering) processing stages.
A `Pipeline` coordinates a set of `AbstractStage` objects and
executes them using a provided scheduler. Stages can generate
additional stages at runtime, and their inclusion is governed by
the scheduler's insertion policy.

Classes
--------
Pipeline
    Manages execution of a sequence of stages using a scheduler.

    Manages the dynamic execution of SAXS processing stages.

    A `Pipeline` coordinates a list of `AbstractStage` instances and
    executes them using a given `AbstractScheduler`. The scheduler
    determines the execution order and decides whether new stages
    requested by existing stages should be added to the queue based
    on its insertion policy.

    ----------
    init_stages : list of AbstractStage
        List of initial stages to execute in the pipeline.
    scheduler : AbstractScheduler
        Scheduler responsible for controlling stage execution and
        handling insertion policies.
