"""Kernel compiler.

Module for building and linking pipeline stages and policies from
declarative specifications.

This module defines compilers that transform declarative pipeline
specifications (e.g., YAML-based or programmatic) into fully
instantiated and linked stage and policy objects for the SAXS
processing pipeline. The compilation process includes building
stage and policy specifications, instantiating stage and policy
objects, and linking them according to dependencies.

The module provides a base compiler (`BaseCompiler`) for general
compilation logic and a `YamlCompiler` for parsing and compiling
from YAML configuration files.

Classes
-------
BaseCompiler
    Provides the core logic for building stage and policy
    instances from declarative specifications, including linking
    stages and policies.
YamlCompiler
    Extends `BaseCompiler` to parse YAML pipeline specifications
    and compile linked stage and policy objects.

Examples
--------
>>> from saxs.saxs.core.kernel.core.core.compiler import
YamlCompiler
>>> compiler = YamlCompiler()
>>> stages, policies = compiler.compile()
>>> stages
Buffer([...])  # Linked stage instances
>>> policies
Buffer([...])  # Linked policy instances

Notes
-----
- Uses `SpecCompiler` to transform declarative specifications into
internal `PolicySpec` and `StageSpec` buffers.
- `StageBuilder` and `PolicyBuilder` create concrete instances
from specs.
- `StageLinker` and `PolicyLinker` establish dependencies between
stages and policies.
- Designed to integrate seamlessly with YAML-based pipeline
definitions.
