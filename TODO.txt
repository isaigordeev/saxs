==========


- o open task
- ± uncertain task 
- (!) important
- (~.) linked (with number of points)
- x closed task

---

- o batch process samples → if stages can handle arrays, vectorize
    numpy operations
- o minimize python object creation → reuse metadata, requests,
    and temporary objects
- o use numba / jit compilation → compile loops if python overhead
    dominates
- o parallelize independent stages → with threadpoolexecutor if
    process releases gil
- o request handler for scheduler
- o allow None for I errors
- o lambda and inject from cache (keeping all stages stateless)
- o metaclass for logging
- o replace python function calculation in processing
    by c++ ones (~.)
- o pipeline scheduler for peaks in order (map-reduce-like) for
      multiprocessing (~.)
- o composite stage (~.)
- o pydantic for gluing metadata between stages
- o compatible with windows? 
- o keep one instance of eval schema and create a simple base one 
- o unwire TStageMetadata from Condition class
- o new Metadata type for eval in the condition
- o new Metadata type for approval in the scheduler
- o policy fallback saxs/saxs/core/stage/abstract_cond_stage.py:84
- o policy for peak choice in peak find
- o scheduler requesting and not stage requesting

- x better scheduler metadata
- x better type hierarchy (with more abstraction and usefulness)
- x change metadata flow
- x new frontend yaml 
- x parser verifier 
- x new backend with declaration specs
- x in-place operations?

- x shoud we encapsulate generic metadata type into a stage?
