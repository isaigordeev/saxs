==========


- o open task
- ± uncertain task 
- (!) important
- (~.) linked (with number of points)
- x closed task

---

- o replace deque.popleft() → use list + index to avoid function
    call overhead
- o batch process samples → if stages can handle arrays, vectorize
    numpy operations
- o minimize python object creation → reuse metadata, requests,
    and temporary objects
- o use numba / jit compilation → compile loops if python overhead
    dominates
- o parallelize independent stages → with threadpoolexecutor if
    process releases gil
- o better scheduler metadata
- o better type hierarchy (with more abstraction and usefulness)

- o default variable stages for compiler
- o change metadata flow
- o request handler for scheduler
- o allow None for I errors

- ± in-place operations?
- ± instance or class injections?
- ± lambda for state factory in injections?
- ± metaclass for logging
- ± pydantic for gluing metadata between stages
- ± replace python function calculation in processing
    by c++ ones (~.)
  - ± pipeline scheduler for peaks in order (map-reduce-like) for
      multiprocessing (~.)
- ± composite stage (~.)
- ± new frontend yaml (~.)
  - ± parser verifier (~.)
- ± new backend with declaration specs (~.)
