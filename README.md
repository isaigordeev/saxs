# SAXS analyse

Gaussian processing and transformer model for classification SAXS data 

TODO

- fine-tuned peak classification
    - huge peak regularization
    - or parabole fit??
- phase class
- direct algo
- finish 4 models 
    - Convolutional or Transormer Model + RNN with peak positions?
- cache for DL
- packaging
– dataset image map creation

Algo special 

first peak and the others of the first wave of searching have the priority
after this priority decreases for Phase classification class
