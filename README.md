# SAXS analyse

Gaussian processing and transformer model for classification SAXS data 

TODO

- ROBUST FLITERING
- finish 4 models 
    - Convolutional or Transformer Model + RNN with peak positions?
- cache for DL
- packaging
â€“ dataset image map creation
____

Algo special 

first peak and the others of the first wave of searching have the priority
after this priority decreases for Phase classification class
